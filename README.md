# Featured Projects

## Optimising Inventory Management Through Data Analysis and Forecasting

### Project Overview
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of sales and product data from a multi-channel retail operation. The goal was to leverage underutilized data to drive improvements in sales performance, inventory management, and customer satisfaction by focusing on key metrics such as revenue, profit margins, and order volume.

**Key Focus**: Enhancing sales performance, operational efficiency, and inventory management strategies through rigorous data analysis.

### Technical Highlights
* **Tools & Techniques**: Used **Python** (**Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**), **SQL**, and **advanced EDA** techniques.
* **Data Scope**: Analyzed over **18,636 transaction records** from 2017 to 2024, capturing intricate details across physical and e-commerce platforms. Included metrics on **product categories**, **pricing**, **revenue**, **cost**, and **profit margins**, along with **customer purchasing behaviors** and **sales channel performance**.

### Key Insights

* **Business Model Insights** - Uncovered a volume-driven business model with an **average transaction value** of **£88.15**, where **revenue** is **driven by mid-priced items** (**£60–£70**). The analysis confirmed a consistent pricing strategy with minimal discounts and a **markup** of **1.25x**, achieving **steady profit margins** averaging **49.4%**.
  
* **Top Performers** - Identified women's footwear (**sandals, sneakers, boots**) as the leading category, contributing significantly to revenue and profitability, with some items achieving margins exceeding **72%**.

* **Challenges & Opportunities** -  Addressed challenges with Women’s Boots and Shoes, which faced negative margins from excessive discounting and cost inefficiencies. Highlighted over **6,600 transactions** with average **discounts of -£34.59** impacting profitability.
  
* **Seasonality and Sales Dynamics** -  Examined the impact of seasonality on sales, noting significant demand peaks during Autumn/Winter, with sharp declines in off-seasons. The analysis also highlighted the dominance of offline sales and the underutilization of online sales channels, presenting growth opportunities.
  
* **Customer Preferences** -  Detailed the pricing preferences with products between £60 and £150 dominating sales, while niche premium items contribute disproportionately to revenue, serving a smaller, specific audience.

### Outcomes

The insights provided enabled strategic realignment of inventory with market demands, optimization of pricing strategies, and leveraging of seasonal trends to enhance profitability and customer satisfaction.

## UK Fixed Broadband Coverage Analysis (2019-2023)
This project provides an in-depth analysis of fixed broadband coverage across 374 UK local authorities using Ofcom datasets. The analysis tracks significant improvements and regional disparities in broadband acess from 2019 to 2023. It includes a detailed examination of various broadband types such as Superfast (SFBB), Ultrafast (UFBB), Full Fibre, and Gigabit broadband.

### Technical Highlights:

* **Data Handling** - Python, Pandas for data cleaning and analysis.
* **Database** - MongoDB for data storage
* **Visualisation** - Matplotlib and Folium for creating insightful maps and charts
* **Data Scope** - Aggregated 1,870 records from five years of data, leveraging multi-dimensional metrics like Full Fibre and Superfast Broadband.

### Key Insights

* **Increased Coverage** - SFBB coverage increased from 93.62% in 2019 to 96.07% in 2023. UFBB saw a rise from 47% to 70%, and Gigabit broadband jumped from 8.5% to nearly 70%.

* **Regional Disparities** - Notable coverage gaps in rural areas compared to urban centers like Birmingham and Leeds. The Orkney and Shetland Islands remain significantly underserved.

* **Infrastructure Investments** - Analysis of areas with rapid infrastructure developments and those still facing digital divides.

### Outcomes

* Actionable Insights - Recommendations for targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas.
* Policy Recommendations - Strategies to enhance broadband coverage, focusing on public-private partnerships and investments in rural connectivity.
